# Robodor Platform

End-to-end IoT door-automation platform: native iOS + Android mobile apps, AWS-native backend, and a web admin console.

> This repository is a **public showcase**. The actual product source (BLE protocol, Modbus register schemas, infrastructure IDs, hardware-specific tunings) is kept private. The code samples here are reusable infrastructure patterns I built during the project — none of them carry any of the proprietary product detail.

## What it is

Robodor sells industrial door controllers. Operators on site control them locally; tenants and service teams manage them remotely. The platform that ships with the product covers:

- **iOS app** (SwiftUI) — local BLE control, settings configuration, telemetry, alerts, charts.
- **Android app** (Jetpack Compose) — feature-equivalent on Android, the original "golden contract" for device behaviour.
- **AWS backend** (CDK + Lambda + Cognito + DynamoDB + S3) — accounts, organizations, roles, telemetry sync, remote command queue, encrypted backups.
- **Web admin console** (React + Vite) — fleet view, per-device telemetry timeline, remote operations.

I designed and built the iOS app from zero, did the dual-platform UI redesign (V2.0), built the AWS backend stack, and stewarded the cross-platform design system.

## Tech stack

### iOS
- Swift 6, SwiftUI, Swift Concurrency (async/await, `@MainActor`, `CheckedContinuation`)
- Combine for repository → view streaming
- Swift Charts for telemetry visualisation
- CoreBluetooth + custom Modbus-over-BLE transport
- Keychain Services, ASWebAuthenticationSession (Google Sign-In)
- Live Activities, App Shortcuts, URL scheme deep-linking
- Swift Package Manager
- 5-language localization (TR / EN / DE / FR / IT)

### Android
- Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3
- Hilt + KSP for DI
- Coroutines + StateFlow
- Custom BLE transport over Modbus RTU
- Foreground service for resilient device sessions
- 5-language string resources

### Backend
- AWS CDK (TypeScript) for the entire stack
- AWS Lambda (Node.js 22)
- Amazon Cognito (User Pools, federated Google Sign-In, JWT verification)
- Amazon DynamoDB (single-table design with GSI)
- Amazon S3 (cold telemetry, encrypted user backups)
- AWS KMS (customer-managed key, envelope encryption)
- API Gateway HTTP API with throttling
- CloudFront + S3 static hosting for the web console

### Tooling
- Xcode + xcodebuild
- Gradle, Android Studio
- ESBuild (Lambda bundling), tsc
- GitHub Actions (CI hooks)

Local control (BLE) and cloud sync are intentionally decoupled: the device is fully usable when offline, and the server never holds a live socket to the hardware.

## Highlights

### Mobile

- **Single-source architecture** — both iOS and Android funnel UI through one repository (`Repository` pattern) that owns BLE state, register cache, polling cadence, and metrics. Views observe; they never reach into the transport.
- **Manual mode safety path** — separate write path for live open/close/stop with shorter timeouts, immediate state drop on timeout, and best-effort STOP write on disconnect.
- **Background session resilience** — declared `bluetooth-central` background mode + scene phase coordination so a screen-lock doesn't kill the active connection.
- **Telemetry history with downsampled buffers** — session / 1h / 24h / 7d rolling buffers in memory, persisted to disk under Application Support with detached writes so the main actor stays unblocked.
- **Design system** — `RobodorPalette`, `RobodorTypography`, `RobodorRadii`, `RobodorShadows` tokens, an `R*` component library, dark + light themes shared across both platforms.
- **5-language localization** — full parity in TR / EN / DE / FR / IT, including dynamic content like door state labels.

### Backend

- **JWT-based auth** with Cognito access tokens, verified server-side via `aws-jwt-verify` + JWKS caching.
- **Server-controlled user profile** — `role` and `organizationId` live in DynamoDB so tokens cannot be used to self-promote into other tenants.
- **Idempotent commands** — clients can supply an `idempotencyKey` and the server uses a DynamoDB `ConditionExpression` to dedupe retries without race conditions.
- **GSI-indexed tenant queries** — card lookups by organization use a partition Query rather than a Scan.
- **Encrypted backups** — settings backups are AES-GCM encrypted on the device, the ciphertext travels through S3, and decryption only ever happens on the user's own device.
- **Hardened Cognito policy** — minimum 12-character passwords with full character-class requirements.
- **API Gateway throttling** — default route rate / burst limits as a baseline DDoS guard.

### Operational

- **Reproducible infrastructure** — the entire stack synthesises from CDK and deploys as a single `cdk deploy`. No manual console clicks.
- **No personal AWS dependency** — IDs and account references are externalised so the same stack drops onto a company-owned account.

The actual product source — BLE/Modbus transport, register catalogue, settings schema, hardware tunings, AWS resource IDs — is **not in this repo** and never will be. What you see here is purely the patterns and infrastructure-side work, sanitised for public viewing.
